The Kaplan-Meier survival curves below represent the survival probabilities of lung cancer patients over time, grouped by variables such as Sex, Age Group, and ECOG Status.

### Description:
This analysis uses Kaplan-Meier survival curves to visualize survival probabilities over time for different patient groups. The curves allow for comparisons across variables such as 'Sex', 'Age Group', and 'ECOG Status'.

- **Y-Axis**: Represents the survival probability, starting at 1.0 (100% survival) at the beginning of the study.
- **X-Axis**: Tracks time in days, showing how survival probabilities decrease as time progresses.
- **Survival Curves**: Each curve represents the survival trend for a specific group within the selected variable. A steeper decline in a curve indicates lower survival probabilities or faster mortality in that group.

### Insights:
1. **Trends in Survival**:
   - Survival probabilities consistently decrease over time for all groups.
   - A steeper decline in a curve indicates worse survival outcomes for that group.

2. **Comparison Between Groups**:
   - Groups with curves that remain higher over time have better survival probabilities.
   - Clear differences in survival curves indicate that the selected variable (e.g., Sex, Age Group, or ECOG Status) has a meaningful impact on survival outcomes.

3. **Long-Term Survival**:
   - Groups with flatter curves or higher survival probabilities at the end of the graph are associated with better long-term survival outcomes.

### Observations from the Graphs:
1. **Survival by Sex**:
   - Two curves represent Male and Female groups.
   - If the Male curve declines more steeply than the Female curve, it suggests that males may have poorer survival outcomes.

2. **Survival by Age Group**:
   - Two curves represent Younger and Older patients (based on the median age of the dataset).
   - A steeper decline for the Older group suggests that age significantly impacts survival, with younger patients having better outcomes.

3. **Survival by ECOG Status**:
   - Curves represent groups based on ECOG performance status, a measure of a patient's ability to perform daily activities (e.g., 0 = Fully active, 1 = Restricted in activities, etc.).
   - Groups with worse ECOG scores (e.g., 1 or higher) show significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to those with better scores.

### How This Analysis Helps:
- This analysis provides critical insights for clinicians and researchers to:
  - Identify high-risk groups based on variables such as Sex, Age Group, and ECOG Status.
  - Tailor interventions to improve survival outcomes for specific groups.
  - Investigate potential biological, treatment-related, or socio-economic factors that contribute to differences in survival probabilities.

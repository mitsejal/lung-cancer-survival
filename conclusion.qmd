# Conclusion

Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, this analysis of survival probabilities for patients with lung cancer provided important new information on how factors including ECOG status, age group, and sex affect patient outcomes. Younger patients often had better survival outcomes than older ones, and patients with higher physical performance (lower ECOG scores) show considerably greater survival. These findings suggest that sex differences may have an impact on survival, with one group exhibiting lower survival odds. The study had several shortcomings, including a small dataset, unidentified confounders, and no statistical validation using tests like the log-rank test, even though the visualisations offered insightful information. By adding more variables, doing statistical analyses, and testing results on bigger, more varied datasets, future research could overcome these constraints. This project demonstrated the power of visualizing survival data to uncover actionable insights, paving the way for more targeted clinical interventions and personalized patient care.

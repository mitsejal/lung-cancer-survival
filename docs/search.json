    "text": "1 Introduction\n\n1.0.1 Why This Topic?\nOne of the most common and fatal types of cancer in the world is lung cancer. Lung cancer patients continue to have a poor survival rate despite advancements in medical technology and therapy, and much more has to be discovered about the variables affecting patient outcomes. Comprehending these variables can aid in directing therapy choices, enhancing patient outcomes, and influencing healthcare regulations.\nResearchers can examine the amount of time until a specific event, like death or the evolution of a disease, occurs by using survival analysis, a potent statistical method. We can learn more about how various characteristics, including age, gender, performance scores, and therapy kinds, affect survival times by using survival analysis to lung cancer data. This type of analysis could advance our knowledge of lung cancer and ultimately lead to better patient care.\n\n\n1.0.2 Questions of Interest\nThe following important questions are the focus of this project:\n\nOverall Survival Probability: How likely is it that patients with lung cancer will survive over time?\nEffect of therapy and Demographics: How do therapy type, age, and gender impact lung cancer patients’ survival times?\nComparative Survival Analysis: What are the most important factors influencing survival outcomes, and how do survival curves vary among different groups?\n\n\n\n1.0.3 Context and Relevance\nDue to its high mortality rate, lung cancer affects millions of people globally and has a major influence on public health systems. Healthcare professionals can create more individualised treatment programs, distribute resources efficiently, and even enhance patients’ quality of life by looking at characteristics that affect survival.\nThis project’s data comes from clinical trials with people who have lung cancer, which offers a wealth of information for examining survival trends. We want to find significant insights that could advance the medical community’s comprehension of lung cancer outcomes by utilising statistical methods including Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox Proportional Hazards models, and forest plots.\n\n\n1.0.4 Significance of This Study\nBoth researchers and medical professionals can benefit from the study’s practical conclusions. Practitioners may be able to make more educated treatment decisions if they can identify the factors that have a substantial impact on survival times. This analysis also emphasises the significance of clinical and demographic aspects, providing a comprehensive perspective on the treatment of patients with lung cancer. The ultimate goal of this project is to assist with continued research aimed at raising the quality of life and survival rates for people with lung cancer.",

    "text": "The Kaplan-Meier survival curves below represent the survival probabilities of lung cancer patients over time, grouped by variables such as Sex, Age Group, and ECOG Status.\n\n4.0.1 Description:\nThis analysis uses Kaplan-Meier survival curves to visualize survival probabilities over time for different patient groups. The curves allow for comparisons across variables such as ‘Sex’, ‘Age Group’, and ‘ECOG Status’.\n\nY-Axis: Represents the survival probability, starting at 1.0 (100% survival) at the beginning of the study.\nX-Axis: Tracks time in days, showing how survival probabilities decrease as time progresses.\nSurvival Curves: Each curve represents the survival trend for a specific group within the selected variable. A steeper decline in a curve indicates lower survival probabilities or faster mortality in that group.\n\n\n\n4.0.2 Insights:\n\nTrends in Survival:\n\nSurvival probabilities consistently decrease over time for all groups.\nA steeper decline in a curve indicates worse survival outcomes for that group.\n\nComparison Between Groups:\n\nGroups with curves that remain higher over time have better survival probabilities.\nClear differences in survival curves indicate that the selected variable (e.g., Sex, Age Group, or ECOG Status) has a meaningful impact on survival outcomes.\n\nLong-Term Survival:\n\nGroups with flatter curves or higher survival probabilities at the end of the graph are associated with better long-term survival outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n4.0.3 Observations from the Graphs:\n\nSurvival by Sex:\n\nTwo curves represent Male and Female groups.\nIf the Male curve declines more steeply than the Female curve, it suggests that males may have poorer survival outcomes.\n\nSurvival by Age Group:\n\nTwo curves represent Younger and Older patients (based on the median age of the dataset).\nA steeper decline for the Older group suggests that age significantly impacts survival, with younger patients having better outcomes.\n\nSurvival by ECOG Status:\n\nCurves represent groups based on ECOG performance status, a measure of a patient’s ability to perform daily activities (e.g., 0 = Fully active, 1 = Restricted in activities, etc.).\nGroups with worse ECOG scores (e.g., 1 or higher) show significantly poorer survival outcomes compared to those with better scores.\n\n\n\n\n4.0.4 How This Analysis Helps:\n\nThis analysis provides critical insights for clinicians and researchers to:\n\nIdentify high-risk groups based on variables such as Sex, Age Group, and ECOG Status.\nTailor interventions to improve survival outcomes for specific groups.\nInvestigate potential biological, treatment-related, or socio-economic factors that contribute to differences in survival probabilities.\n\n\n\nSelect Variable:  Sex Age Group ECOG Status",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, this analysis of survival probabilities for patients with lung cancer provided important new information on how factors including ECOG status, age group, and sex affect patient outcomes. Younger patients often had better survival outcomes than older ones, and patients with higher physical performance (lower ECOG scores) show considerably greater survival. These findings suggest that sex differences may have an impact on survival, with one group exhibiting lower survival odds. The study had several shortcomings, including a small dataset, unidentified confounders, and no statistical validation using tests like the log-rank test, even though the visualisations offered insightful information. By adding more variables, doing statistical analyses, and testing results on bigger, more varied datasets, future research could overcome these constraints. This project demonstrated the power of visualizing survival data to uncover actionable insights, paving the way for more targeted clinical interventions and personalized patient care.",
